Should users have to create unique IDs for their resources, or will you do that for them? If the former, how
will they know what kind of IDs to create and if they’re unique? If the latter, how will you return that ID
to them (as they’ll need the ID to perform future actions on that resource)?
--> I will create the unique IDs for the resources. I will return the ID to the user in the response body of
    the POST request.


Any data accepted from a client needs to be validated to ensure it’s correct. What constraints should you
enforce? Will you restrict genres to a certain subset of values?

-->I will enforce the following constraints:
-->-->Author id must point to an id in the author table
-->-->Genre must be one of the following: "dystopian", "romance", "horror", "mystery", "fantasy", "sci-fi"
-->-->Combination of title and author id and pub_year must be unique


Books are associated with authors. Should you be able to create a book without a valid author ID? Should
you be able to delete an author that still has books associated with them?
-->As stated in the last question, any book added to the system must point to an author also in the system.
-->I will not allow an author to be deleted if they have books associated with them. I will return an error
    message to the user if they try to delete an author with books associated with them.
